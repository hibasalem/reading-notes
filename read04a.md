# Read: 04a - Programming with JavaScript

### Intro 

JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly.jQuery makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.
JavaScript allows you to accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.(Access the content of the page,Modify the content of the page ,Program rules or instructions the browser can follow ,React to events triggered by the user or browser)
it makes the web page interactive by responding to what user does (example : A button is pressed, A link is clicked (or tapped) on, A cursor hovers over an element)

### The ABC of programming 

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.(like a hand book or manual)
To write a script, we need to first state a goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. (1: DEFINE THE GOAL , 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT ,3: CODE EACH STEP).
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step neededto complete that task (a flowchart can help to work out how the tasks fit together.The flowcharts show the paths between each step.)


### Expressions + Operators

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.there are two types of expressions.
( just assign a value to variable and the other one use two or morer values to return a single value )
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

##### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers.![photo](000.JBG)

##### STRING OPERATOR
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
