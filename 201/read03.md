## Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

### switch statement
starts with a variable called the ***switch value*** Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.   
   
Data types can be coerced from one type to another.   

### loops 

it check a condition If it true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again until the condition returns false     
  
***types***   
* for( run code a specific number af times the condition is usually a counter w to tell how many times the loop should run)    
it is made up of three statements:initailation(create a variable for the countaer) condition (how many times) update(add one to the counter every time the loop runs)
*  while (the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true) 
* do while same as the while but it will run the code once even if the condition is false
