### CH 1 Structure
HTML uses tags to give the information they surround special
meaning.
Tags are often referred to as elements.
Tags usually come in pairs(opening and closing)
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

# CH 17 HTML5 Layout

For a long time, web page authors used **div** elements to group
together related elements on the page.
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page such as The **header footer  nav section aside article hgroup div**
The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple div elements).
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed.

# CH 8 Extra Markup

Since the web was first created, there havebeen several different versions of HTML.thats why each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML.

### Attributes

a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
block level elements Examples of block elements are  h1 p ul and li
