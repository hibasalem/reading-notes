## Review, Research, and Discussion


* **Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle**

The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app

* **Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC**

a server is a computer or program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.   it provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients,  so its the part that we send requests to and get responces from 


* **What does it mean to “deploy” an application?**

deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. The goal of a deployment Making an application available to end users. and it incloudes all of the processes involved in getting new software or hardware up and running properly in its environment, including installation, configuration, running, testing, and making necessary changes.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* **Server** a server is a computer or program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.   it provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients,  so its the part that we send requests to and get responces from        

* **Pub/Sub**  publishers and subscribers. is a model where Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events , Publishers send events to the Pub/Sub service, without regard to how or when these events will be processed. Pub/Sub then delivers events to all services that need to react to them. Compared to systems communicating through RPCs, where publishers must wait for subscribers to receive the data, such asynchronous integration increases the flexibility and robustness of the system overall. Pub/sub used to enable event-driven architectures, or to decouple applications in order to increase performance, reliability and scalability.    
  
* **WRRC** The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app , it includes the client sending a request to the backendd server , the backend server would do some prosese then send a respond back to the client

> **Amazon EC2** : Elastic  compute cloude, a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud , it allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. ( virtual computing environment)   


> **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** : a service that deploy , manges and scales web apps . 
 on familiar servers such as Apache HTTP Server.    

>  Virtual Machine (VM) :  is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.
