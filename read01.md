## Text editor 

A text editor is an important tool, we should found a suitable text editor for us, that one should have code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, and the ability to choose from a selection of extensions and Emmet. 
we need a text editor that can grow with us as our needs grow (in the form of extensions"plugins")to add functionality .you can use what is already on windows or install new ones like Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.

## The Command-Line (terminal)

most people open up a command-line interface just as another window on their desktop, we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time.
"A command line is a text-based interface to the system makes us able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text"
to open a command line on Windows you will need an SSH client such as Putty.

a nice thing that there are Shortcuts.

pwd Print Working Directory Where are we currently
ls List the contents of a directory
cd Change Directories move to another directory

## Paths

 path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system, there is absolute and relative. 
Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system. they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
Absolute path:A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

some more building blocks to help build your paths.
~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory
. (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory.
.. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory.

If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.
When we start typing a path you may hit the Tab key at any time which will invoke an auto-complete action.

## More About Files
basically everything is a File even keyboard and monitor.
Linux doesn't care about the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is, Linux is Case Sensitive, space is how it separate item
if the file or directory's name begins with a. (full stop) is considered to be hidden.
