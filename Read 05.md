### Comparison and logical operators

##### Evaluating conditions 
we can evaluate by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will true or false. this uses operators usch as == equal and != not equal ( for value only ) , === equal and !== not equal ( for value and data type) and,< > <= >= .

##### logical operators 
this allows us to compare the results of more than one comparison operator ( which they usualy true or false ) by adding /&& (logiacal and , both true) /|| (logical or one or more true ) /! (logical not invert the boolean value ) between them.

##### loops

it check a condition If it true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again until the condition returns false

types
**for** ( run code a specific number af times the condition is usually a counter  to tell how many times the loop should run), **while** (the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true) and,**do while**

for is made up of three statements:initailation(create a variable for the countaer) condition (how many times) update(add one to the counter every time the loop runs)
